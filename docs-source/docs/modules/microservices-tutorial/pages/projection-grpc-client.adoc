= VIII: Projection calling gRPC service
:page-supergroup-java-scala: Language

include::ROOT:partial$include.adoc[]

To complete the example, we need a way to handle orders. We will add another Projection from the events of the `ShoppingCart` entity. We will also create a gRPC Order Service, `ShoppingOrderService`. The Projection calls the Order Service when the shopping carts are checked out.

This part of the xref:overview.adoc[full example] focuses on the gRPC client in the `SendOrderProjection`. On this page you will learn how to:

* call another service with xref:concepts:akka-grpc.adoc[Akka gRPC]
* implement another gRPC service by adding the `ShoppingOrderService`

== Add the Order gRPC service

Let's add the service that handles shopping cart orders. The template and source downloads include a directory named `shopping-order-service` for this purpose. To add the order gRPC service, follow these steps:

. Open the `shopping-order-service` in IntelliJ just as you did with xref:template.adoc#intellij[ the shopping-cart-service]. 

. Define the interface of the service in a protobuf service descriptor. It should be located in the `src/main/protobuf/ShoppingOrderService.proto` in the new `shopping-order-service` project.
+
[source,protobuf]
----
include::example$shopping-order-service-scala/src/main/protobuf/ShoppingOrderService.proto[]
----

. Generate code by compiling the project:
+
[.group-java]
[source,shell script]
----
mvn compile
----
+
[.group-scala]
[source,shell script]
----
sbt compile
----

. Implement the `ShoppingOrderService` in a new class `ShoppingOrderServiceImpl`:
+
[.tabset]
Java::
+
.src/main/java/shopping/order/ShoppingOrderServiceImpl.java:
[source,java,indent=0]
----
include::example$shopping-order-service-java/src/main/java/shopping/order/ShoppingOrderServiceImpl.java[]
----

Scala::
+
.src/main/scala/shopping/order/ShoppingOrderServiceImpl.scala:
[source,scala,indent=0]
----
include::example$shopping-order-service-scala/src/main/scala/shopping/order/ShoppingOrderServiceImpl.scala[]
----

. Similar to the xref:grpc-service.adoc[gRPC server for the ShoppingCartService] we need to initialize the gRPC server. Add a `ShoppingOrderServer` [.group-scala]#object# [.group-java]#class#:
+
[.tabset]
Java::
+
.src/main/java/shopping/order/ShoppingOrderServer.java:
[source,java,indent=0]
----
include::example$shopping-order-service-java/src/main/java/shopping/order/ShoppingOrderServer.java[]
----

Scala::
+
.src/main/scala/shopping/order/ShoppingOrderServer.scala:
[source,scala,indent=0]
----
include::example$shopping-order-service-scala/src/main/scala/shopping/order/ShoppingOrderServer.scala[]
----

. Call the `ShoppingOrderServer.init` from `Main`:
+
[.tabset]
Java::
+
[source,java,indent=0]
----
include::example$shopping-order-service-java/src/main/java/shopping/order/Main.java[]
----

Scala::
+
[source,scala,indent=0]
----
include::example$shopping-order-service-scala/src/main/scala/shopping/order/Main.scala[]
----

NOTE: The `grpc.port` configuration is defined in `local1.conf`, which is included in the generated template project.

== Create the Projection

The new Projection for `shopping-cart-service` events will be similar to the one we developed for Kafka on the xref:projection-kafka.adoc[previous page], but when it receives `ShoppingCart.CheckedOut` events, it will call the `ShoppingOrderService`. 

Create the Projection as follows:

. Include the service definition by copying the `ShoppingOrderService.proto` file from the `shopping-order-service` to the `shopping-cart-service/src/main/protobuf` directory. 

. Generate code by compiling the `shopping-cart-service` project:
+
[.group-java]
[source,shell script]
----
mvn compile
----
+
[.group-scala]
[source,shell script]
----
sbt compile
----

. Add a `SendOrderProjectionHandler` class in the `shopping-cart-service` project. This is the Projection `Handler` for processing the events:
+
[.tabset]
Java::
+
.src/main/java/shopping/cart/SendOrderProjectionHandler.java:
[source,java,indent=0]
----
include::example$shopping-cart-service-java/src/main/java/shopping/cart/SendOrderProjectionHandler.java[]
----

Scala::
+
.src/main/scala/shopping/cart/SendOrderProjectionHandler.scala:
[source,scala,indent=0]
----
include::example$shopping-cart-service-scala/src/main/scala/shopping/cart/SendOrderProjectionHandler.scala[]
----

<1> `ShoppingOrderService` is the gRPC client
<2> Retrieve the full shopping cart information from the entity. In the order we need to include the list of items and their quantities. That information is not included in the `ShoppingCart.CheckedOut` event, but we can retrieve it by asking the `ShoppingCart` entity for it.
<3> Call the `ShoppingOrderService`. If the call to the `ShoppingOrderService` fails, the returned [.group-scala]#`Future[Done]`# [.group-java]#`CompletionStage<Done>`# fails and the Projection is automatically restarted from the previously saved offset. This will result in retrying the call to the `ShoppingOrderService`. Since the Projection has `at-least-once` semantics, the `ShoppingOrderService` must be idempotent, that is, it must gracefully handle duplicate order attempts for the same `cartId`.

== Initialize the Projection

The tagging of the events is already in place from when we created the xref:projection-query.adoc#tagging[query Projection]. So, we just need to initialize it as follows:

. Place the initialization code of the Projection in an `SendOrderProjection` [.group-scala]#object# [.group-java]#class#:
+
[.tabset]
Java::
+
.src/main/java/shopping/cart/SendOrderProjection.java:
[source,java,indent=0]
----
include::example$shopping-cart-service-java/src/main/java/shopping/cart/SendOrderProjection.java[]
----

Scala::
+
.src/main/scala/shopping/cart/SendOrderProjection.scala:
[source,scala,indent=0]
----
include::example$shopping-cart-service-scala/src/main/scala/shopping/cart/SendOrderProjection.scala[]
----

. In `Main`, invoke the `SendOrderProjection.init` and create the gRPC client for the `ShoppingOrderService` like this:
+
[.tabset]
Java::
+
[source,java,indent=0]
----
include::example$shopping-cart-service-java/src/main/java/shopping/cart/Main.java[tag=SendOrderProjection]
----

Scala::
+
[source,scala,indent=0]
----
include::example$shopping-cart-service-scala/src/main/scala/shopping/cart/Main.scala[tag=SendOrderProjection]
----
+
The reason for placing the initialization of `orderServiceClient` in a `protected` method is that tests can then replace it with a stub implementation.

. The gRPC client is using service discovery to locate the `ShoppingOrderService`. For local development add the following to `src/main/resources/local-shared.conf`, which is loaded when running locally:
+
[source,hocon]
----
include::example$shopping-cart-service-scala/src/main/resources/local-shared.conf[tag=grpc]
----

== Run locally

Follow these steps to run locally and exercise the new Projection and service:

. Start Postgres and Kafka, unless they are already running:
+
[source,shell script]
----
docker-compose up -d
----

. Run the `shopping-order-service` with:
+
[.group-java]
[source,shell script]
----
# make sure to compile before running exec:exec
mvn compile exec:exec -DAPP_CONFIG=local1.conf
----
+
[.group-scala]
[source,shell script]
----
sbt -Dconfig.resource=local1.conf run
----

. Try the new order service directly with `grpcurl`:
+
[source,shell script]
----
grpcurl -d '{"cartId":"cart1", "items":[{"itemId":"socks", "quantity":3}, {"itemId":"t-shirt", "quantity":2}]}' -plaintext 127.0.0.1:8301 shoppingorder.ShoppingOrderService.Order
----

. Keep the `shopping-order-service` running, and in another terminal run the `shopping-cart-service` with:
+
[.group-java]
[source,shell script]
----
# make sure to compile before running exec:exec
mvn compile exec:exec -DAPP_CONFIG=local1.conf
----
+
[.group-scala]
[source,shell script]
----
sbt -Dconfig.resource=local1.conf run
----

. Use the checkout in the shopping cart service with `grpcurl` (note the different port number):
+
[source,shell script]
----
grpcurl -d '{"cartId":"cart1", "itemId":"scissors", "quantity":1}' -plaintext 127.0.0.1:8101 shoppingcart.ShoppingCartService.AddItem

grpcurl -d '{"cartId":"cart1"}' -plaintext 127.0.0.1:8101 shoppingcart.ShoppingCartService.Checkout
----

. In the terminal of the `shopping-order-service` you should see the log of the order:
+
----
Order 12 items from cart cart1
----

=== Stop the service

When finished: 

. Stop the `shopping-cart-service` and `shopping-order-service` with `ctrl-c`. 

. Stop Postgres and Kafka with:
+
[source,shell script]
----
docker-compose down
----
